Scientific progress depends on standard datasets for which claims, 
hypotheses, and algorithms can be compared and evaluated. Despite 
the importance of having standard datasets, it is often impossible 
to find the original data used in published experiments, and at 
best it is difficult and time consuming.

The network repository (networkrepository.com) is an effort to 
improve and facilitate the scientific study of networks by making 
it easier for researchers to download, analyze, and investigate a 
large collection of network data. Our goal is to make these 
scientific datasets widely available to everyone while also 
providing a first attempt at interactive analytics on the web.

For this purpose, we ask that you please acknowledge the repository 
in any published materials. Please use the following to refer to 
this repository:
